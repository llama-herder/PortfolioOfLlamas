# Project: Hestia
## Team 205: Who-Wa-Way
## Team Members:
1. LuYan Tan
1. Ethan Conner
1. Maryam Younan
1. Lana Harkin
## Preparation Date: 1/26/2024
## University: Arizona State University (ASU)
## Class Name: EGR314: Embedded System Design Project II
## Semester: Spring
## Year: 2024
## Professor: Travis Kelley


## Charter:
* Our team's goal is to create a portable weather station to inform the user of the current humidity, temperature, and other weather data. This device will be able to travel across the ground to create a localized weather map using temperature and humidity, connecting to wifi as well as alerting the user of severe weather changes. 
## Mission Statement:
* The primary objective is to create a user-friendly R/C car that can autonomously compile real-time environmental conditions. Additionally, the system will incorporate a feature for manual control. This design will seamlessly integrate temperature and humidity sensors, providing an innovative solution for the ultimate mix between work and play.
